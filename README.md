## Hi there, I'm Joe ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

Most of my repositories are faculty related projects (ending with '-FEUP' or '-FILS' for my Erasmus projects done in Universitatea PolitehnicÄƒ din BucureÈ™ti ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´) but there are a couple of weekend projects in there like:  
 - [Tone Generator](https://github.com/JoeMGomes/tone_generator) - A small Rust application that writes Pulse Code Modulation ( PCM ) audio files from json files.
 - [GenunPro](https://github.com/JoeMGomes/GenunPro) - Procedurally generated universe based on [javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA) video  ["Procedural Generation: Programming The Universe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZY9YE7rZJw&t=592s) 

My favourite faculty projects:
 - [LCOM-FEUP](https://github.com/JoeMGomes/LCOM-FEUP) - A very low level game made for MINIX operating system. Mouse/Keyboard, graphics and networking drivers were all implemented by a team of two.
 - [ACG-FILS](https://github.com/JoeMGomes/ACG-FILS) - A 3D Graphics Engine with Bounding Box collisions implemented.

 - [DJCO-Final-Project-FEUP](https://github.com/JoeMGomes/DJCO-Final-Project-FEUP) - A 3D Puzzle-Horror Game where I worked as a Game Developer, Designer and Story Writer in a team of 4 developers and three designers.

I got my Masters degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering ðŸ’¾ at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) and am currently working in the gaming industry as a Tools/Engine Programmer!
