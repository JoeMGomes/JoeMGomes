## Hi there, I'm Joe ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Portuguese Student ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ currently on my way to become a Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering ðŸ’¾ at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP).

Most of my repositories are faculty related projects but there are a couple of weekend projects in there like:  
 - [Tone Generator](https://github.com/JoeMGomes/tone_generator) - Small Rust application that writes Pulse Code Modulation ( PCM ) audio from json files.
 - [GenunPro](https://github.com/JoeMGomes/GenunPro) - Procedurally generated universe based on [javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA) video  ["Procedural Generation: Programming The Universe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZY9YE7rZJw&t=592s)
